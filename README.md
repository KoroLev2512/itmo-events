# ITMO.EVENTS: study project for university events

This project is intended for ITMO students who organize and participate in university events.
In ITMO.EVENTS, event organizers can create events and open registration for them, select participants
and send them notifications within the platform, without using third-party resources.

## Setup

To familiarize yourself with the instructions for launching and using the backend and frontend parts,
you need to go to the appropriate folder.

## Status

Now the project is on hold, as we switched to a different language for the backend, a different framework for the frontend, and did a redesign due to the requirements of the information systems department.

We intend to resume work on the project after integrating the new project into ITMO.

## Gratitude

We are grateful to the React team for the React framework that we used to create this application.
